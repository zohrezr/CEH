$\color{#b91646}{\textsf{Buffer overflow}}$
============================================

### $\color{#25678D}{\textsf{What it means}}$

- **malloc and pointers**
- **Stack smashing (overwriting or corrupting the return pointer)**
- **Adding NoP to memory and then jump, just like an airplane sliding on a loooong strip. Kind of padding the memory**
Why
DoS + Bypass security + Or even run code (say for opening a port)
C & C++ do not automatically check for this. 
strcpy can copy data into memory
Check ‘code red’
IDS/IPS on Host + writing good code with boundary validation + having cookies (canary value) in memory and checking them + stack guard (saving return values and checking them) + using tools like splint (checks for BO possibilities) + logs
On hardware level, there are NX (no exec) or XD (exec disabled) flags for memory
heartbleed
