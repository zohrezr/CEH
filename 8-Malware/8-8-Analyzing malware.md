$\color{#b91646}{\textsf{Analyzing malware}}$
=============================================

- Do it on LAB!
- Check md5s/hashes when downloading, even if you are downloading from the main site (beware on DNS spoofing)
- Sheep Dip Systems (Dip your sheep first to kill the parasites). Run the program / connect the USB, … and check all processes, file hashes, network connections, … before and after. Isolate it.
- Debugging / Disassembling tools (bintext searches for text, OllyDbg, IDAPro, Ghidra,  …) or checking UPX  (packager) to check software packages and licences ( upx -L filename) 
- UTM (Unified Threat Management) + checking threat with the cloud. The cloud service can even check and update the Firewall (Say VirusTotal.com)
