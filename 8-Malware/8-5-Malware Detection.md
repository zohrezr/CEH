$\color{#b91646}{\textsf{Malware Detection}}$
=============================================

چطوری می تونیم تشخیص بدیم که سیستم ما malware داره یا نه؟

Star with an updated anti virus
Check below and search for unknowns
Ports (netstat -a -n , tcpview, currports, ...)
Processes (process monitor)
Registry Entries (is huge! So you will need tools like jv16, regscanner)
Device Drivers (msinfo can show drivers or even hide all MS ones (from view))
Services (msinfo, service manager)
Startup Apps (can start from different places so you can go with this tool: security autorun)
Files and folders (tools like SFC, SIGVERIF & FCIV will save and check hashes. Also there is 3rd party tripwire. sfc /?)
Network Activities. This happens a lot when you are compromised. Specially if protocol is used unusually (say repeated ICMP with PacketID 0). We will see this more on sniffing.
